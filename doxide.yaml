    These pages demonstrate some of the features of Doxide, and also serve as
    a test corpus. They are generated from the source files in the
    [demo](https://github.com/lawmurray/doxide/tree/main/demo) directory of
    the repository, as well as from the source code of Doxide itself. This
    first page demonstrates how [groups](../organizing.md) can be used to
    organize documentation.
