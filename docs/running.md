# Running Doxide

Build the Markdown documentation with:
```
doxide build
```
This will populate the output directory (default: `docs`).

To publish your documentation with Material for MkDocs, use:
```
mkdocs build
```
This will populate the `site` subdirectory with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This directory can be published.

To serve the documentation locally, use:
```
mkdocs serve
```
and point your browser to the URL reported, usually `localhost:8000`.
