# Initializing Doxide

Run, from within your source code directory:
```
doxide init
```
This will create a `doxide.yaml` configuration file, as well as some
additional files for publishing with [Material for
MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). To start, it is not
necessary to modify any of these.

Add at least `doxide.yaml` to version control, and the other files if you intend to use Material for MkDocs (highly recommended for a quick start---you can always try something else later).
